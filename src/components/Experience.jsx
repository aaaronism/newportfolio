        Embarking on a journey that blends creativity with technology,<br />
        I have over a year of professional experience as a Software Engineer, with a strong digital marketing background.<br />
        As a developer with a passion for problem-solving, I've created automation solutions to company processes using Python, significantly increasing workplace efficiency by 50%.<br />
        Additionally, I've developed a sign-in application for our office, minimalizing paper consumption and decreasing the daily intake time of employees and guests.<br />
        My responsibilities extend to managing and enhancing the company website and learning management system, where I take pride in implementing modifications and programming new features.<br />
        My interest in 3D models and ML/AI are topics that don't relate to my current responsibilities, but I have taken it upon myself to learn and experiment with these aspects of coding on the side.<br />
        <br />
        Beyond the professional realm, I enjoy...<br />
        capturing life's moments, shooting and editing photos/videos so that my creative mind continues to thrive.<br />
        traveling, fueling my curiosity and my willingness to try new things, as well as exposing me to diverse cultures and perspectives.<br />
        consistently staying active/going to the gym as we can't forget that it's equally as important to exercise the body, as it is the brain.
